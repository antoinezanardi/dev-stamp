# Script: create-git-branch.sh
# Description: Creates a new Git branch with a standardized naming convention.
# The branch name follows the pattern: <job_type>/<branch_name> where:
#   - job_type is selected from a predefined list (feat, fix, docs, etc.)
#   - branch_name is a kebab-case string provided by the user
#
# Usage: ./create-git-branch.sh
